a server-side component of a “movies” web application.

The web application will provide
users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. 
Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.


The complete server-side of your web application, including the server, business logic,
and business layers of the application. It will consist of a well-designed REST API and
architected database built using:

 -JavaScript

 -Node.js

 -Express

 -MongoDB

 The REST API
will be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST. Similar methods
(CRUD) will be used to retrieve data from your database and store that data in a non-relational
way.
